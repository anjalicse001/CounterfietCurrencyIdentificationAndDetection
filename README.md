# CounterfietCurrencyIdentificationAndDetection


we studied convolution neural network-based deep learning approaches
for counterfeit currency detection. We began by exploring the dataset, putting it into 7
different classes, splitting and visualizing it for our analysis, and preprocessing the data
to ensure its integrity.
We first employed Xception Model approach. Further, we leverage a few deep learning approaches such as VGG16, MobileNet, DenseNet, and Model Ensemble. Finally,
the deep convolutional neural network was analyzed which performed best among all
the methods. We evaluated the performance of the employed models using Accuracy
and accuracy scores, a common metric for assessing image classification. This quantitative measure helped us gauge the performance of our models in predicting real vs fake
currency notes.
By leveraging deep learning techniques and model ensemble methods, the study aims
to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of counterfeit currency detection systems, contributing to the security and integrity of currency systems. The findings of this study can
be applied in real-world scenarios, such as financial institutions and law enforcement
agencies, to implement more effective and automated counterfeit currency detection systems, thereby contributing to the security and integrity of currency systems.
In essence, our journey encompassed the extraction and exploration of the dataset, the
implementation of two distinct model architectures, and evaluation of their performance
using advanced techniques in CNN-based deep learning. This project has provided us
with valuable insights into the intricacies of image classification systems using CNN and
showcased the versatility of such methods in capturing complex image details.
As we move forward, the lessons learned from this project will undoubtedly contribute to our understanding of developing effective and scalable fake currency detection
algorithms, and the techniques employed can serve as a foundation for future endeavors
in the realm of wider currency verification systems.
